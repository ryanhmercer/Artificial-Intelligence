Coding Projects done in my Artificail Intelligence Course.

Puzzle:

Program that solves a basic 8-puzzle game. Implements different searching techniques including dfs and using heuristics to do A* search.

Sudoku:

A program that is able to solve a given sudoku board with backtracking as well as forward checking to boost efficiency.

IntellgentAgent:

Python code provided implements the expectiminimax algorithm to effectively play popular internet game 2048. Also implements some other heuristics
including monotnicity to increase accuracy and reach higher scores. With tuning of heuristics, agent is able to consistently reach 2048 and will
rarely fall to 1024.
